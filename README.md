# Dockerized TICK-Stack
This repo show you how you can dockerize TICK Stack.

For this you need to install ubuntu. My ubuntu version is 20.04 LTS. 
After Installing ubuntu you can run commands provided in the Report.

Note: All the commands I have used are in -d (detach mode) you can run them without detach mode also. Then for each component use separate terminal.
